        };
    }
}

// Use 403 for actions for users who have been authenticated 
// Use 401 for login / Register  

// authentication is the process of verifying who someone is
// authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to

/* He suggests doing the opposite ???

In summary, a 401 Unauthorized response should be used for missing or bad authentication, and a 403 Forbidden response should be used afterwards, when the user is authenticated but isnâ€™t authorized to perform the requested operation on the given resource.
